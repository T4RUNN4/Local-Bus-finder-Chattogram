The other day, I was working on some tasks. Then suddenly I noticed something. Almost every city has a system where users can find details about local buses and their routes. But for my city, Chattogram (previously Chittagong), there is nothing like this.

So, I thought of making one by myself, in which user can search for local bus available for their destination and possible fare amount. And there it is.

Well, for this website, these tech stacks are used. The goal of this website was to keep it minimal and user-friendly and not overly complicated. 

All the information on Bus Route and Fare amount is collected from the Government Website of "Chatto-Metro," published in 2022. 

## Features

This website focuses on functionality rather than features. So, this website has a very minimal amount of features.

- <b> Route and Fair Finder </b>: This is the core functionality of the website where users can input their location and destination point and find the available buses with a possible fare amount.

- <b> Multilingual Support </b>: Although this website is made for people in Bangladesh, there is also English language support for non-Bangladeshi people so that everybody can use it. 
- <b> Data Improvement </b>: Since the source of data is a little bit backdated now, users can report wrong data via Google Form.

## Developers Note

If you are a User and using this website for finding Bus routes, then don't blindly depend on website and do a cross-check.
